Explicit parameterization of subdivision surfaces for texture mapping adds
significant cost and complexity to film production. Most parameterization
methods currently in use require setup effort, and none are completely general.
We propose a new texture mapping method for Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces
that requires no explicit parameterization. Our method, Ptex, stores a separate
texture per quad face of the subdivision control mesh, along with a novel
per-face adjacency map, in a single texture file per surface. Ptex uses the
adjacency data to perform seamless anisotropic filtering of multi-resolution
textures across surfaces of arbitrary topology. Just as importantly, Ptex
requires no manual setup and scales to models of arbitrary mesh complexity and
texture detail. Ptex has been successfully used to texture all of the models in
an animated theatrical short and is currently being applied to an entire
animated feature. Ptex has eliminated UV assignment from our studio and
significantly increased the efficiency of our pipeline.
